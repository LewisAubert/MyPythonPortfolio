#The purpose of this code is to generate a band name. This is our band name generator.
#It takes the input of the name of the city you were born in
#The code then asks you what your first pet's name is
#The code then adds the two strings together to produce a potential band name!
#The \n function allows the user to input their answer on a new line.

print("Welcome to band name generator.")
city = input("What is the name of the city you grew up in?\n")
pet = input("What is the name of your first pet?\n")

print("Your band name could be " + city + " " + pet)
