#I have noticed that for the example given in the beginning, the output displays 33.6, when I want it to display 33.60. To get around this formatting error, you need to use the function split = "{:.2f}".format(payment)

split = "{:.2f}".format(payment)

print(f"Each person should pay ${split}")

# using the f-string here so that I can combine the different variables without having to change their type in the code.
